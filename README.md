# ros_Navigation_with_docking

Contain urdf of AMR with navigation modules and config.

-> my_sim contains all my test code

-> need to download the lastest libs. please take the project libs as example and for reference.



-> docking algo works with 1 2D lidar and 2 reflective strips 60cm apart and can successfully dock with 99% accuracy.



I apologize for the messy codes, I am still learning and mainly use this as my personal storage. My final codes are put in company repo and no available for public use.
